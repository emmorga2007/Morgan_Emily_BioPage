#M&E Team Bio Page

## About: Creating A Rudimentary Team Bio Page

Here we have the web development team page for the fictional M&E Web-Dev company. This is the company behind the soon to be released and much talked about Lysol Line-Up web launch. This team consists of one hard working individual who tasked herself with the challenge of launching this up-coming website all on her own. <br>
On this team page you can expect to find a brief description of the team itself, along with the head shots of the teams lead developer and designer. When either head shot it clicked on, the information below will change to display to corresponding short bio of the team member. <br>
