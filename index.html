    <p>
      Welcome to M & E Web-Dev team page. If you're thinking our designer, Emily Morgan, and our developer, Emily Morgan, are the same person then you are correct! In these hard times (and in order to cut the timely cost of social interactions) we made the executive decision to keep it in the family. A family of 1! And, if you’re thinking we made a poor choice and took on more work then we needed, then you would be correct, again! Click on the profile images below to view our employee profiles.  </p>

    <p>
    Emily Morgan is our novice back-end developer here at M & E Web-Dev. Emily was a package deal with her design counterpart: Emily. Much to the detriment of our clients. She is eager to learn – however – and where she is underdeveloped in her development skills, she makes up for in hard work. Having an outstanding grasp of HTML and CSS, she is hoping to compensate for her less then reputable knowledge of Javascript currently. We here at M & E Web-Dev want to wish her a summer full of learning! for all our sakes!
